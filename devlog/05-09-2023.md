oh my god... AC peace at last

I was screwing around with PPP earlier today, only been up like 6 hours so far

not sleeping well due to being so hot and muggy

now working on this, have drive

I'm thinking of a "display standard" or pattern of writing code

since the `display.show()` call takes an array of stuff, you can make scenes or icons as a function that outputs these specific items... even complex stuff... I was initially think objects but nesting stuff can get tricky... may still be involved...

also the size of text dictates the size of evertyhing else right now since can't control font size currently
