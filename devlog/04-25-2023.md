so apparently it's a char write limit per file 128... don't know the reason although that is one of those base 2 numbers

block size or something idk

anyway so it means when grouping/writing code to monocle for now needs a middle layer that chunks things down.

I was thinking about this... one way is to use an inrementing filename like `original_#.py` and then keep adding more as needed

it does suck because each file can only be so big... so it's like this tree that keeps getting bigger

so idk, it's a temporary solution

2:44 AM

going to add a char counter to the snippets

3:15 AM

oh yeah... so now that you don't care about the char count since it will just break the programs up into plain text chunks... don't need it lol remove

3:57 AM

I need a drag-drop feature to reorder the snippets

4:08 AM

ugh... this is one of those things... I could integrate a library but is it worth it

I could do it myself but is it as good

do I need this at all?

I'm going with no for now, this is a nice to have

this snippet way with selectable is not that great... a file system view is ideal

4:58 AM

ugh... my brain is getting crappier as time moves on

I know what I have to do I just feel overwhelmed, what part do I start on first, how do I track it

I know what the vision is (demo while cooking) I want to do this first thing, breakfast

the part I don't have yet is the loader controller per file

it's a tree

- main.py
  - app
    - loader
      - app files

eyes on the prize

1) welcome
2) basic home/dock
3) start reading hn
4) start reading reddit world news

I have to make these scenes work on their own, then integrate as a larger app, then separate

Or I could build the separate thing/loader first...

other thing that is challenging is tracking ram usage/alerting user or handling it

5:25 AM

oh yeah one other issue is the display library was reworked so the old way to do stuff doesn't work anymore

have to remake all the snippets I had before like a battery indicator

6:18 AM

yeah this won't happen today, need a fresh brain to do the grouping

there are also a lot of unknowns with the new library like offsets don't work right, 0, 0 starting point doesn't work...
