so apparently it's a char write limit per file 128... don't know the reason although that is one of those base 2 numbers

block size or something idk

anyway so it means when grouping/writing code to monocle for now needs a middle layer that chunks things down.

I was thinking about this... one way is to use an inrementing filename like `original_#.py` and then keep adding more as needed

it does suck because each file can only be so big... so it's like this tree that keeps getting bigger

so idk, it's a temporary solution

going to add a char counter to the snippets

oh yeah... so now that you don't care about the char count since it will just break the programs up into plain text chunks... don't need it lol remove

I need a drag-drop feature to reorder the snippets

ugh... this is one of those things... I could integrate a library but is it worth it

I could do it myself but is it as good

do I need this at all?

I'm going with no for now, this is a nice to have

this snippet way with selectable is not that great... a file system view is ideal
